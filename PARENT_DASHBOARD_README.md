# Parent Dashboard - TutorNearby

## Overview
The Parent Dashboard allows parents to manage their children's tutoring accounts. Parents can add children under the age of 12 as students, view their profiles, and monitor their academic progress.

## Features

### 1. Parent Profile Management
- View personal information (name, email, phone, age)
- Quick stats showing number of children registered
- Profile overview with contact details

### 2. Child Management
- Add children under 12 years old as students
- View all registered children with their details
- Monitor children's academic levels and account status
- Each child gets their own independent student account

### 3. Age Validation
- **Children under 12**: Can be added by parents
- **Children 12 and older**: Must register themselves (existing validation in `registerUser` function)
- Age validation is enforced both on frontend and backend

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### ParentController.js
- `addStudentToParent`: Adds a child student to a parent's account
- `getParentProfile`: Retrieves parent profile with associated children
- `updateParentProfile`: Updates parent profile information
- `getParentDashboardStats`: Gets dashboard statistics
- Age validation: Ensures only children under 12 can be added by parents

#### ParentRoutes.js
- `POST /api/parent/add-student`: Add child to parent
- `GET /api/parent/profile/:user_id`: Get parent profile with children
- `PUT /api/parent/profile/:user_id`: Update parent profile
- `GET /api/parent/dashboard-stats/:user_id`: Get dashboard statistics

#### Models
- `ParentProfileSchema`: Stores parent-user relationship with student references
- `UserSchema`: User accounts with role-based access
- `StudentProfileSchema`: Student-specific academic information

### Frontend Components

#### ParentDashboardPage.jsx
- Main dashboard interface
- Displays parent profile and children list
- Integrates with AddChildModal for adding new children

#### AddChildModal.jsx
- Modal form for adding children
- Form validation including age restrictions
- Password requirements matching student registration standards

#### ParentContext.jsx
- Context provider for parent operations
- Handles authentication and error management
- Reusable across multiple components

### Security Features
- JWT token authentication required for all parent operations
- Role-based access control (only users with 'parent' role)
- Age validation on both client and server side
- Password strength requirements for child accounts

## Usage Flow

1. **Parent Registration**: Parent registers with role 'parent'
2. **Login**: Parent logs in and accesses dashboard
3. **Add Child**: Parent clicks "Add Child" button
4. **Child Form**: Parent fills child details (name, email, age < 12, academic level, password)
5. **Validation**: System validates age and other requirements
6. **Account Creation**: Child account is created and linked to parent
7. **Dashboard Update**: Child appears in parent's children list

## API Endpoints

### Add Child to Parent
```
POST /api/parent/add-student
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body: {
  parent_user_id: string,
  full_name: string,
  email: string,
  password: string,
  age: number,
  academic_level: string (ObjectId)
}
```

### Get Parent Profile
```
GET /api/parent/profile/:user_id
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: {
  parentProfile: object,
  children: array
}
```

### Update Parent Profile
```
PUT /api/parent/profile/:user_id
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body: {
  // fields to update
}
```

### Get Dashboard Stats
```
GET /api/parent/dashboard-stats/:user_id
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: {
  totalChildren: number,
  activeChildren: number,
  inactiveChildren: number
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Age Restrictions
- **Parent**: Must be 20 or older
- **Child via Parent**: Must be under 12
- **Independent Student**: Must be 12 or older

- Form validation with inline error messages
- Loading states during API operations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- Child progress tracking
- Session scheduling for children
- Payment management for children's sessions

**Note**: This parent dashboard is designed to work alongside the existing student and tutor systems without modifying their core functionality. Parents can manage their children's accounts while maintaining the same security and validation standards used for independent student registration.
