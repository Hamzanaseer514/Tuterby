            question: "Are these questions only for specific subjects like Maths or Sciences?",
            answer: "While often associated with STEM subjects, we can develop challenger questions across a wide range of disciplines, including humanities and social sciences, focusing on critical analysis, argumentation, and research skills."

          {
            question: "How do these differ from regular 'hard' questions?",
            answer: "They are typically more open-ended, require synthesis of knowledge from different areas, and may not have a single 'correct' answer, focusing instead on the process of reasoning and justification. They often mimic the style of university-level problem-solving."

          {
            question: "Is this service suitable for students who are not necessarily 'gifted' but are very hardworking?",

          {
            question: "How are these integrated into tutoring sessions?",
            answer: "Challenger questions can be set as independent tasks, discussed in detail during sessions, or used as a basis for project work, depending on the student's goals and the mentor's approach. The focus is always on guided exploration and learning."
