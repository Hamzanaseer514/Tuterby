            question: "What types of SEN do your resources cater to?",
            answer: "We aim to support a broad spectrum of SEN, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and general learning difficulties affecting literacy, numeracy, or executive functions. Resources are often designed with specific needs in mind or are adaptable."
          },
          {
            question: "Are your tutors trained to work with SEN students?",
            answer: "Many of our tutors have specific experience and training in working with students with Special Educational Needs. When matching a student with SEN to a tutor, we prioritize finding someone with the relevant expertise and a compassionate approach."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you ensure the resources are effective without 'dumbing down' the curriculum?",
            answer: "Our focus is on accessibility and appropriate support, not on reducing academic rigor. We adapt the presentation and method of engagement to suit different learning styles, but the core learning objectives and curriculum content remain aligned with age and stage expectations. The goal is to provide alternative pathways to understanding complex material."
          },
          {
            question: "Can parents request specific types of SEN resources for their child?",
            answer: "Yes, we encourage open communication. Parents can discuss their child's specific needs and learning profile with us, and we will do our best to provide or create the most suitable resources, often in collaboration with the assigned tutor."
