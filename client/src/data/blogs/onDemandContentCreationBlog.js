            answer: "We aim to accommodate a wide range of requests. However, very extensive or complex resource creation (e.g., a full mock exam paper) might require more than the standard 24-48 hour turnaround and could be better suited to our standard custom content services. We'll always clarify feasibility upon request."

            question: "Who can request on-demand content?",
