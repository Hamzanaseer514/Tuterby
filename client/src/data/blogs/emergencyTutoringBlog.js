            question: "How quickly can I realistically get connected with an emergency tutor?",
            answer: "While our goal is to connect you with a tutor within 2 hours, and often much faster, actual availability can vary depending on the subject complexity, academic level (GCSE, A-Level, University), time of day, and current tutor schedules. We always prioritize urgent requests and will communicate transparently with you about expected connection times. Many students are connected well within the 2-hour window."
          },
          {
            question: "Is emergency tutoring significantly more expensive than regular sessions?",
            answer: "Our standard hourly rates typically apply for emergency tutoring. We believe in transparent and fair pricing. Any potential variations for extremely short-notice requests outside standard hours or for highly specialized expertise would be clearly communicated to you upfront before you commit."
          },
          {
            question: "What range of subjects and levels are covered for emergency tutoring sessions?",
            answer: "We cover a very wide range of core subjects for GCSE, A-Levels, IB, and many common undergraduate university modules. Popular requests for emergency help include Maths, English, Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), Computer Science, Economics, and essay writing assistance."
          },
          {
            question: "Can I get specific help with a difficult assignment question or understanding a marking scheme?",
            answer: "Absolutely. Our tutors are skilled at helping you understand complex concepts, deconstruct challenging assignment questions, approach problem-solving effectively, and interpret marking schemes. They will guide you to find the answers and develop your own understanding, rather than providing direct answers, thereby upholding academic integrity and fostering genuine learning."
          },
          {
            question: "Is emergency tutoring available 24/7?",
            answer: "While we strive to cover as many hours as possible with our diverse network of tutors, our highest tutor availability is generally during standard UK daytime and evening hours, including weekends. However, urgent requests are continuously monitored, and we do our utmost to accommodate needs outside typical hours whenever feasible."
          },
          {
            question: "I need an 'urgent tutor near me' for an in-person session. Is this possible?",
            answer: "Our emergency tutoring primarily utilizes our online platform for the quickest response times. While we do have tutors offering in-person sessions, arranging an 'urgent tutor near me' for a face-to-face meeting within a few hours can be more challenging logistically. We recommend online for most emergency needs, but you can always inquire about local urgent availability."
