          {
            question: "How 'short' are these notes typically, and how do they compare to full textbooks?",
            answer: "The length varies significantly by topic and subject complexity, but the core emphasis is always on brevity, clarity, and direct relevance to exam specifications. They might range from a single, densely packed page of bullet points for a specific concept to a few well-structured pages for a broader topic summary. They are designed to capture the most critical information, unlike exhaustive textbooks."
