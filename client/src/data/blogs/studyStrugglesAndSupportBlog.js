It's not uncommon for students to face periods where they struggle with focus, motivation, or find that certain habits and distractions are taking a toll on their academic performance. This could be anything from procrastination and difficulty concentrating, to more significant challenges like managing digital addictions (gaming, social media) or other coping mechanisms that have become counterproductive."

            answer: "Absolutely. Any personal information shared during consultations or with our support team is treated with the strictest confidence, in line with our privacy policy. If there are concerns about immediate safety, we follow safeguarding protocols, always aiming to support you."

            question: "Are your tutors qualified to help with mental health or addiction issues?",
            answer: "Our tutors are academic specialists and empathetic mentors. They are not mental health professionals or addiction counsellors. However, they can provide academic support that may alleviate stress, help you re-engage with studies, and they can listen compassionately. Crucially, they can help signpost you to qualified professional services if your needs go beyond academic support."

            question: "What if I'm not sure if my problem is 'serious' enough?",
            answer: "If something is impacting your studies or wellbeing, it's worth discussing. There's no 'seriousness' threshold. An early conversation can often prevent smaller issues from becoming larger ones. We're here to listen and help you figure out the best support for you."

          {
            question: "Can tutoring really help if I'm addicted to gaming or social media?",
            answer: "Tutoring can play a supportive role. By making study sessions engaging, structured, and rewarding, it can help shift focus and build positive routines. Tutors can also help you create study plans that incorporate breaks and manage time effectively, reducing the urge to escape into distractions. However, for addiction itself, professional help is often essential, and we can support you in finding that."
          },
          {
            question: "What kind of specialist services can you refer me to?",
            answer: "Depending on your needs, we can suggest looking into NHS mental health services (like CAMHS for younger students or IAPT for adults), private counselling or therapy options, university student support services, and reputable UK charities and organizations that specialize in addiction support or mental wellbeing."
