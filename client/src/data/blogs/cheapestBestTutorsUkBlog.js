            question: "How can I find the cheapest tutors on the TutorNearby platform?",
            answer: "When you submit an enquiry or search on our platform, clearly specify your budget considerations if possible. While we don't solely rank tutors by price, as quality is paramount, we aim to match you with tutors whose rates are within a range you are comfortable with. Online tutors often present more competitive pricing options due to lower overheads."
          },
          {
            question: "Does opting for cheaper tutors mean they are less qualified or experienced?",
            answer: "Not necessarily. Tutor rates can vary due to a multitude of factors, including their geographical location (if in-person), overhead costs, years of experience on a specific platform versus overall experience, and subject demand. TutorNearby has a vetting process to ensure all listed tutors meet essential quality standards. Always review individual tutor profiles thoroughly and engage in an initial conversation."

            question: "Is online tutoring generally more affordable than finding a local 'tutor near me' for in-person sessions?",
            answer: "Frequently, yes. Online tutors typically have fewer overhead expenses (like travel costs, time, and physical resources) and can often reach a wider student base, which can translate into more competitive pricing. However, this can vary based on the tutor's individual circumstances and specialization."

Carefully review their academic qualifications, relevant teaching/tutoring experience, stated teaching philosophy, and any available student feedback or testimonials. An initial conversation or a trial lesson (if offered by the tutor) is invaluable for assessing their communication style, subject mastery, and compatibility with the student's learning needs."
