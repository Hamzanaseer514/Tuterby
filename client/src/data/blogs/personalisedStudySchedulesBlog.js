          {
            question: "How is a personalised study schedule created?",
            answer: "It's a collaborative process between the student and their TutorNearby mentor. It involves discussing current workload, goals, learning preferences, and any challenges. The mentor then helps structure this into a practical, balanced schedule."
          },
          {
            question: "How often should a study schedule be reviewed or updated?",
            answer: "It's good practice to review the schedule weekly, at least initially, and make adjustments as needed. As exams approach or coursework deadlines shift, the schedule may need more significant updates. Our mentors guide students through this."
          },
          {
            question: "What if my child struggles to stick to a schedule?",
            answer: "This is common, especially at first. Our mentors provide support and strategies for building consistency, addressing reasons for not sticking to the plan (e.g., if it's too ambitious or not engaging enough), and fostering self-discipline in a positive way. The key is to find a schedule that genuinely works for the individual."
          },
          {
            question: "Do these schedules only focus on academic work?",
            answer: "No, a good schedule promotes balance. We encourage students to include time for extracurricular activities, hobbies, exercise, socialising, and adequate rest. This holistic approach is crucial for overall wellbeing and sustained academic performance."
