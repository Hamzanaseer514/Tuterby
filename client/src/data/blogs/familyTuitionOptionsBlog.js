            question: "Do you offer discounts if I enroll multiple children for tutoring?",
            answer: "We often have special considerations or packages for families enrolling multiple children. Please contact us to discuss potential sibling discounts or family rates for our tutoring services UK."
          },
          {
            question: "Can one tutor teach multiple subjects or different age groups within my family?",
            answer: "Some of our tutors are versatile and experienced in teaching multiple subjects or across different age ranges. However, for specialized subjects or significantly different levels (e.g., primary vs. A-Level), it might be more effective to have specialist tutors for each. We can coordinate this for you."
          },
          {
            question: "My children have very different learning styles. Can you accommodate that?",
            answer: "Absolutely. Our tutors are skilled at adapting their teaching methods to suit individual learning styles, ensuring each child in your family receives the most effective support."
          },
          {
            question: "Can parents also receive tutoring through a family plan?",
            answer: "Yes! We encourage lifelong learning. If parents wish to upskill, learn a new language, or improve their IT skills, this can often be incorporated into a broader family tuition discussion or plan."
