        faqs: [
          {
            question: "What programming language is best for beginners in game development?",
            answer: "C# with Unity is often recommended for beginners due to Unity's user-friendly interface and extensive learning resources. Python with engines like Pygame is also a good starting point for 2D games to learn programming concepts."
          },
          {
            question: "How long does it take to develop a game?",
            answer: "It varies massively! A simple mobile game might take a few weeks or months. A complex PC or console game can take years with a large team. For learning, expect to spend several months building foundational skills before tackling larger projects."
          },
          {
            question: "Do I need to be good at art or music to make games?",
            answer: "Not necessarily. Game development has many roles. If you're a programmer, you can focus on coding and use pre-made assets or collaborate with artists and musicians. However, understanding design principles is beneficial for all roles."
          },
          {
            question: "How do I start learning AR/VR development with Unity?",
            answer: "Begin by mastering Unity basics and C#. Then, explore Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit and specific SDKs for your target AR/VR platform (e.g., Oculus SDK, ARCore, ARKit). Start with simple projects like placing virtual objects in AR or creating basic VR interactions."
          },
          {
            question: "What kind of games can I build for the Metaverse?",
            answer: "The Metaverse allows for a wide range of experiences: social games, adventure games, simulations, educational experiences, virtual concerts, and more. It often involves user-generated content and persistent worlds. Skills in 3D modeling, scripting (often Lua or JavaScript on platforms like Roblox), and understanding player interaction in shared spaces are key."
          },
          {
            question: "Can I learn game development entirely online?",
            answer: "Absolutely! There are countless online resources, tutorials, and courses. TutorNearby provides personalized online tutoring to guide you through this learning journey, offering structured support and expert feedback."
