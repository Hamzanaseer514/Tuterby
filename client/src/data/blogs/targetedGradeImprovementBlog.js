            question: "How quickly can we expect to see grade improvement?",
            answer: "The timeframe for grade improvement varies depending on the student's starting point, the specific challenges, and their consistent effort in implementing the strategies. Some improvements in understanding and technique can be seen relatively quickly, while significant grade jumps may take more sustained effort over a term or longer. We focus on steady, sustainable progress."
