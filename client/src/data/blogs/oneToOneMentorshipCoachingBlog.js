            question: "How is a mentor matched with a student?",
            answer: "We take great care in matching students with mentors based on personality, learning style, specific needs, subject interests (if relevant to academic coaching), and the student's stated goals. The aim is to foster a strong, positive rapport."

          {
            question: "How often do mentorship sessions take place and how long are they?",
            answer: "This is flexible and tailored to the student's needs. Sessions might be weekly or fortnightly, typically lasting for about an hour. The frequency can be adjusted as the student progresses."
          },
          {
            question: "Is mentorship only for students who are 'struggling'?",
            answer: "Not at all! While it's incredibly beneficial for students facing challenges, mentorship can also help high-achieving students to set ambitious goals, explore new interests, develop leadership skills, or navigate transitions (e.g., to A-Levels or university)."
          },
          {
            question: "What's the difference between a tutor and a mentor/academic coach?",
            answer: "A tutor typically focuses on specific subject knowledge and curriculum content. A mentor or academic coach takes a broader approach, focusing on study skills, time management, motivation, goal setting, confidence, and overall academic strategy, though there can be overlap. Some of our professionals offer both."
